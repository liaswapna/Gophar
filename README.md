# Gophar
### Overview
---
This app helps to plan a road trip, by giving an idea about the options we can choose between the orgin and destination of the trip. It also gives an idea about the weather, geographical feature of the place and distance to cover between two places. To finish this task, I used google API and Openweather APIs.

### Requirements
---
The app takes input as origin and destination and call the google API to get the location.
* When the user clicks on search button, the app calculates the distance and route, then display it on the map.
* The user can choose other options like resturants, gas station etc and add it along the trip.
* The app also helps to display the weather details and geographical feature details.
* The app also helps to get the current location of the user.
